                        "In true dialogue, both sides are willing to change." — Thích Nhất Hạnh

                    <p>This quote encapsulates my approach to education. I believe that teaching is not merely about transferring knowledge but creating spaces where genuine dialogue can flourish. My teaching philosophy centers on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Inclusive Learning Design:</strong> Creating accessible, engaging mathematics experiences that meet diverse learner needs and build confidence in STEM disciplines.</li>
                        <li><strong>Analytics-Driven Pedagogy:</strong> Using learning analytics to identify intervention points, personalize learning pathways, and continuously improve teaching approaches.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mastery-Based Assessment:</strong> Implementing formative assessment models that emphasize growth, reflection, and mastery rather than high-stakes testing alone.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In practice, this means developing learning environments where students can explore mathematical concepts through curiosity-led approaches, receive timely and constructive feedback, and develop a growth mindset toward mathematics and STEM subjects.</p>
