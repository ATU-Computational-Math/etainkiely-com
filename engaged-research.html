                <div class="content-bg">
                    <p>Engaged research involves collaborative knowledge creation with community partners, stakeholders, and end-users. This approach to engaged research is characterized by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Co-Creation:</strong> Working alongside community partners to define research questions, methodologies, and outcomes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reciprocity:</strong> Ensuring mutual benefit for both academic and community partners.</li>
                        <li><strong>Real-World Impact:</strong> Focusing on research that addresses practical challenges and leads to tangible solutions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Knowledge Exchange:</strong> Facilitating two-way learning between academic expertise and community wisdom.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This approach enables research that is not only academically rigorous but also socially relevant and impactful.</p>
